# GQLx

An efficient, low-memory consuming GraphQL IDE for your desktop to quickly explore and test GraphQL APIs.

## Why does this project exist?

There are many great GraphQL IDEs out there that provide you with the necessary features needed to explore and test GraphQL servers.

Sometimes, however, all you are looking for is a minimal interface without the clutter to quickly explore your GraphQL schemas - an interface that, although minimal by nature, is not missing essential features for you to easily explore your graphs.

This is where **GQLx** comes into play.
