# GQLx

A GraphQL client for your desktop with a low-memory footprint, designed to quickly explore and test GraphQL APIs.

## Why does this project exist?

There are many great GraphQL clients out there that provide you with the necessary features needed to explore and test GraphQL servers.

Sometimes, however, all you are looking for is a minimal interface without the clutter to quickly test your GraphQL endpoints - an interface that, although minimal by nature, is not missing essential features for you to easily explore your graphs.

This is where **GQLx** comes into play.

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS
